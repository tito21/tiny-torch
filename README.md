# Tiny-Torch

Many people use deep learning frameworks such as `pytorch` or `tensorflow` but few people can understand how they work
fully. And that is not a bad thing, these are complex pieces of software that took many years to perfect.

This project aims to make a simple deep learning framework that has all the main features of the major ones with a easy
to understand codebase.

The main features it must have
 - Fully functional compute engine with cpu and cuda backends
 - Automatic diferentation
 - Simple `pytorch` like python API for deep learning

# Building and installing

Just run `python setup.py install`

# Run test aginst pytorch

`python test/test.py`
